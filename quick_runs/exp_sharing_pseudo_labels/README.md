## Overview

The scripts in this folder are used for experience sharing experiments where only 
the parameters are shared between agents. The parameters are used to generate 
pseudo labels on unlabeled data. With the pseudo labels and unlabeled data, we can 
train a new agent to obtain experience from an existing model.
